# MiniUI-ScummVM-Pak

ScummVM pak for MiniUI using the ScummVM libretro core by [StupidHoroscope](https://github.com/StupidHoroscope), including the aux/additional data files and themes.

# Installation

Download the release zip and extract to the root of your SD card.

# Usage

Usage is the same as with any of the other MiniUI emulators.

Save states are __not__ supported.  Press the Start button to bring up the ScummVM menu and save and load there.

## Audio Noise

Enable Speed Hack in the emulator options to eliminate audio noise if you're experiencing any.

## Loading and Quitting Games

Which game file to load is different for each game.  If you select the wrong file, the system will hang and the battery needs to be pulled to power off.

Exit only through the MiniUI menu.  If you exit through the ScummVM launcher, the system will hang and can only be powered off by pulling the battery.
